* Edit the help file skeletons in 'man', possibly combining help
  files for multiple functions.
* Edit the exports in 'NAMESPACE', and add necessary imports.
* Put any C/C++/Fortran code in 'src'.
* If you have compiled code, add a useDynLib() directive to
  'NAMESPACE'.
* Run R CMD build to build the package tarball.
* Run R CMD check to check the package tarball.

Read "Writing R Extensions" for more information.

* Some instruction here
* This package only consists of 2 functions. One of them is  
* generate_dataR(dimnum,samplenum), another is Example(samplenum = 300,
* dimnum = 2000,exper_time = 5,r1=2,r2=1,tau=0.2,gamma=3.7,lambda=1) with 
* default setting as above.
* If you want to know the runtime, then use system.time(Example()) function 
* would be a good choice.
